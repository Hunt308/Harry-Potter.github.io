            <h2>JK Rowling</h2>
            <p>Joanne Rowling is the author of the world's best selling Harry Potter books. She was born into Yate, England and loved writing for her entire life. Harry Potter was like her own world in her imagination. She lived in poverty for a period of time where she used to write ideas for Harry Potter on napkins, could barely afford her own place to live, and didn't know where she will be in life. Miraculously, she not only was able to publish the book series, but each of her books became an instant best seller. The books sold so well that they had long lines of people at the book store when each book debuted and inspired the Harry Potter franchise. The success led to the creation of a movie series that also received huge success, Harry Potter theme parks, and a huge fanbase called Potterheads. The series impacted a generation and the books are often called by critics and audiences alike as some of the greatest novels ever written.

            <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
            <p> During the production of the film, JK Rowling wanted an all British to reflect that it takes place in London. Often called the home town of Harry Potter. The actors chosen to play Harry and his two best friends Ron and Hermione had to be children. The funniest thing about the actors who played Ron and Hermione is they had very little acting experience. They only have attended school plays barely and weren't even sure they would get the part. Despite the lack of experience, the actors became loved by Potter fans and critics alike. The actors chosen worked together for 10 years. The movies were well received for being able to watch the actors grow, have their relationships unfold, and feel like not only best friends, but also family. The series starts off as a fun family adventure, but gets darker and darker each installment.  This led to criticism from some for it's massive tone change, though JK Rowling said this was due to the characters maturing and finding the dark side of the wizarding world, similar to in the real world teenagers discovering the dark side of growing up. Despite the tone change, each film did very well, and final film "Dealthy Hallows Part 2" was the best rated film in the series and best selling film of 2011.

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>The final Harry Potter novel was released in 2007 and the last movie of the series was released in 2011. For years many assumed this series will have no more sequels and it was about Harry's journey. However, recently JK Rowling has expanded the Potterverse into more of the wizarding world. In July 2016 JK Rowling collaborated John Tiffany and Jack Thorne with new play after Harry Potter called the Cursed Child. The play received great praise from critics along with the book. Later that same year, a new movies series Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was released. The series will be 5 films and expands on Harry's book he had to read for Hogwarts also called Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.  The film takes place 70 years before Harry Potter's journey and tells the story of magical creatures and items from the wizard Newt Scamander. The series will continue the wizarding world that fans have to come to enjoy so much.
